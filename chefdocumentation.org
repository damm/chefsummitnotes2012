* New Chef Documentation
[[http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/New+Chef+Documentation][New Chef Documentation Notes]]
** Summary
Documentation is a passable reference. Opscode goal is to create an excellent reference that also has a recognizable structure.
*** [[http://docs.opscode.com][docs.opscode.com]] - is open
Currently [[https://github.com/opscode/chef-docs][chef-docs]] is still private, it should be marked public soon.
*** Now with Sphinx
There's many different ways to have markup, Opscode has settled on Sphinx reStructuredText.
*** Weekly Review
+ Just like they do with regular chef code.
+ No CCLA Requirement, it is under Creative Commons.
+ Potentially create a ticket, then fork the repo, create a topic branch, make changes... open pull request, follow same pattern.
+ Documentation will become a part of the regular pull process in time.
