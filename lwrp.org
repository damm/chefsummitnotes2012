* LWRP Summit
** Limitations
Some of the limitations of LWRP were brought up.  The audiance appeared to be unaware not being able to use =include_recipe= or =require_recipe= or =values_for_platform=.
*** Dependency Resolution
It was suggested that it would be nice if we could either provide dependency resolution at the Resource level.  Such as.
#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
def initialize(*args)
  super
  @action = :install
  @cookbook_context.depends ["build-essential","bob"]
end
#+END_SRC
Unfortunately this would require the cookbook loader to essentially run twice.  
*** Learning Curve
Most people came to the talk hoping to learn how to write a LWRP.  Unfortunately as there was no Projector no code was shared.
